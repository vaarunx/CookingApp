Recipetin (CookingApp) is a simple blog and a place where you can store your recipes of your favourite food. 
Users can create their own account and either create a blog post and share it to the world or create their own recipes. 
The user-created recipes are hidden to every other user but the blog post is visible to the world.

Made on django.
